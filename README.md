# Twindred!
An independent project for the purposes of learning Python.

This Flask App began with the noblest of intentions--to find kindred spirits using sentiment analysis and the Twitter API.  But language is a fickle thing, and the best laid plans were led astray by sarcasm.

Instead, I present a project which enables you to randomly walk through related hashtags with the click of a button.  Why?  Because it turns out a hashtag says more than any of the characters around it.

## Technologies
